This repository contains Python code for the "python-api-challenge."

There are two directories:

1) WeatherPy
2) VacationPy

Each directory contains a jupyter notebook file with Python code.

WeatherPy.ipynb uses custom functions to call weather data from the OpenWeather API.
This file also contains plots based on the calls.

VacationPy.ipynb uses the .csv output from WeatherPy.ipynb to plot humidity and select hotels based on specified weather conditions.
